## Challenges Faced
1.  Inputting string object that has no get method. (Attribute Error)
2.  Used Tkinter window to show the pop-up message like press 'e' for quitting but ended up with a not responding page --> Resolved by removing it.
3.  During the detection,webcam window is not quitting which lead to restart the kernel --> Later resolved using a Hexadecimal Constant(0xFF).
