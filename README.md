## Challenges Faced

1. Inputting string object that has no get method (Attribute Error)
2. Used Tkinter window to show the pop-up message like “Press e for quitting” but ended up with a not responding page à Later Resolved by removing it and adding the popup message    to the webcam window. 
3. During the detection, webcam window is not quitting which lead to restart the kernel  à Later resolved using a Hexadecimal Constant (0xFF).
